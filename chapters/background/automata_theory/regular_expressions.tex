Regular expressions are a formal language which is used to represent languages, that is, sets of strings.
Regular expressions are equivalent in expressive power to the DFAs and NFAs presented above,
but in many cases humans find them more pleasant to work with.

\begin{definition}
    The language $R_\Sigma$, the set of regular expressions over the alphabet $\Sigma$,
    is inductively defined as the smallest set satisfying the following rules:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The empty set is a regular expression:
        $\emptyset \in R_\Sigma$.
        \item The empty string $\epsilon$ is a regular expression:
        $\epsilon \in R_\Sigma$.
        \item A character from $\Sigma$, like $a$, is a regular expression:
        $\forall c \in \Sigma: c \in R_\Sigma$.
        \item Two regular expressions, concatenated using the operator $\cdot$, is a regular expression:
        $\forall r, s \in R_\Sigma: r \cdot s \in R_\Sigma$.
        In most cases, the operator is omitted to make the regular expression more concise.
        \item Two regular expressions, combined using the operator $+$, form a regular expression:
        $\forall r, s \in R_\Sigma: r + s \in R_\Sigma$.
        \item An application of the postfix operator $\ast$ to a regular expression is a regular expression:
        $\forall r \in R_\Sigma: r^\ast \in R_\Sigma$.
        \item A regular expression, surrounded by $()$, is a regular expression:
        $\forall r \in R_\Sigma: (r) \in R_\Sigma$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

As with every formal language, a semantics is required for regular expressions to define their meaning.

\begin{definition}
    The following inductive definitions map regular expressions over an alphabet $\Sigma$ to languages:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\Lang{\emptyset} = \{\}$
        \item $\forall c \in \Sigma: \Lang{c} \coloneqq \{c\} $
        \item $\forall r, s \in R_\Sigma: \Lang{r \cdot s} \coloneqq \Lang{r} \Lang{s}$
        \item $\forall r, s \in R_\Sigma: \Lang{r + s} \coloneqq \Lang{r} \cup \Lang{s}$
        \item $\forall r \in R_\Sigma: \Lang{r^\ast} \coloneqq \Lang{r}^\ast$
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

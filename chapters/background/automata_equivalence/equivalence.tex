The following definitions transform the question of
whether two automata are equivalent to
whether the set of their starting states are equivalent.
This definition is more general and useful
for the exposition of the algorithms that determine equivalence.

\begin{definition}
    Two finite automata $M$ and $N$ are merged with the following definitions.
    \begin{align}
        Q_{M \sqcup N} = Q_M \cup Q_N \\
        \Sigma_{M \sqcup N} = \Sigma_M \cup \Sigma N
    \end{align}

    The sets $Q_M$ and $Q_N$ have to be disjoint, which
    can always be ensured by renaming states.
    This is required to ensure that the languages of each subset of states are preserved.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Two sets of states $P$ and $Q$ of an NFA $M$ are considered
    to be equivalent iff they accept the same language:

    \begin{align}
        P \equiv Q \iff \Lang{P} = \Lang{Q}
    \end{align}
\end{definition}

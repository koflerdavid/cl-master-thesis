\section{Automata Theory}

    Automata theory is concerned with the study of abstract automata and computational models.
    The aim is to study their essential properties and which types of computational problems can be solved by using them.

\section{Automata Equivalence and Inclusion}

    One of the most interesting applications of automata theory are model~checking and verification.
    The goal is to check whether a specification has certain properties
    or whether the realisation of a specification behaves as expected.
    Naturally, the question of equivalence between two model arises:
    how can two automata, maybe a simulated and a real one reconstructed from a trace,
    shown to be equivalent?

    The following section explains the necessary theoretical background and presents a
    new development in this field.
